Summary: Possible Interesting Genes
Flower Structure, Flowering, and Flowering timing
Row 430 (-2.08), floral homeotic protein (HUA1) (AGAMOUS pathway) in Arabidopsis.  Zag 1 is the maize homolog of this protein and it is similar to maize Zag 2.  Zag 1 and Zag 2 are domestication genes. Zag 1 is thought to have been selected possibly for its effects on seed non-shattering (Weber et al. 2008). It is a MADS-box gene, a large gene family. They are key regulators of plant inflorescence and flower development (e.g., the determination of floral meristem and organ identity as in AGAMOUS) and a number were maize domestication and improvement genes.

Row 1466 (-2.3) In maize this is ZMM4 MADS-box protein. MADS-box family gene with MIKCc type-box in rice. Important roles in floral development.  ZMM4 has been studied in maize and may play roles in both floral induction and inflorescence development.  From article on ZMM4 in maize, link below:  “Expression analysis in late flowering mutants positioned all four genes downstream of the floral activators indeterminate1 (id1) and delayed flowering1 (dlf1). Overexpression of ZMM4 leads to early flowering in transgenic maize and suppresses the late flowering phenotype of both the id1 and dlf1 mutations.” See Row 1910 below.

Tb1-related, TCPs
Row 702 (-2.03) TCP transcription factor 44 in maize. It is TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, cycloidea and PCF transcription factor 2 in Arabidopsis.
Some notes on tb1 and other TCPs, their interactions with hormones and other genes and influences on branching, and other notes on hormonal actions.  
From Koyama et al. article on Arabidopsis—“TCP3, a model of CIN-like TCPs of Arabidopsis thaliana, directly activates the expression of genes for miR164, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID3/SHORT HYPOCOTYL2 (IAA3/SHY2) (this is auxin), and SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) proteins. Gain of function of these genes suppressed the formation of shoot meristems and resulted in the fusion of cotyledons, whereas their loss of function induced ectopic expression of CUC genes (regulate formation of shoot meristem) in leaves. Our results indicate that miR164, AS1, IAA3/SHY2, and SAUR partially but cooperatively suppress the expression of CUC genes (CUC genes induce shoot meristem activity).”
The Kebrom et al. article in Trends in Plant Science (“Grasses provide new insights into regulation of shoot branching”) is excellent, with a great review of hormonal regulation of branching, hormonal interactions with tb1 and other TCPs,  and other factors regulating shoot branching. Some information from Kebrom et al. Strigolactone is a new hormone discovered in eudicots and grasses that controls branching. It is directly regulated by cytochrome 450 and we have a large number of genes in the cytochrome 450 family differentially expressed (see below). Strigolactone synthesis is regulated by the availability of nutrients such as phosphate (Row 1322). “In some plants (rice and Arabidopsis) strigolactone blocks bud outgrowth by directly or indirectly regulating TB1”  “Cytokinin  biosynthesis is reduced by auxin and exogenously applied cytokinin can promote bud outgrowth to overcome apically derived auxin [29,32]. Strigolactone and cytokinin have an antagonistic relationship.  In addition, there is a correlation between the level of abscisic acid and bud dormancy [33].” 
What abscisic acid does: stimulates the closure of stomata and drought responses (water stress brings about an increase in ABA synthesis), inhibits shoot growth, inhibits the effect of gibberellins by reducting de novo synthesis of a-amylase.  In rice, ABA is the primary hormone that mediates plant responses to stresses such as cold, drought and salinity.
Kebron et al. summary, “Bud outgrowth is regulated by genetic, hormonal, developmental, and environmental factors, and the interaction between these factors determines the dormancy versus outgrowth fate of an axillary bud.”
Also from Kebrom et al.; “Where there are differences, these lie in the interplay between hormonal networks, for example strigolactone reduces polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis and rice, but perhaps not in pea [37,50,54,57], or in the regulation of specific genes. TB1-like genes act downstream of strigolactones to inhibit bud outgrowth in both monocots and dicots, and “Recently, it was shown that branching in rice and pea was inhibited by the application of the strigolactone analogue, GR24 [46,47].”
Also from Kebrom et al. and Bolduc and Hake 2009 paper; Knotted 1 in maize (Row 812, see below) is a homeobox gene and upregulates GA2ox1, the gibberellin catabolism gene (cited is Bolduc, N. and Hake, S., 2009) “The maize transcription factor KNOTTED1 directly regulates the gibberellin catabolism gene ga2ox1.” Plant Cell 21, 1647–1658). Knox also regulates cytokinin synthesis. Gibberellin deficiency can cause dwarfism in maize and less bud outgrowth. Gibberellin also plays a role in flower sex determination in maize. GA1 promotes shoot elongation in maize. From the Bolduc et al. Knox 1 maize paper: “a peak of Knox 1 loci was identified in a region that behaves as an enhancer for expression of teosinte branched1 (Studer et al. 2011).”   From Colebrook review of gibberellin “Evidence is accumulating that suppression of GA signaling is a general response to abiotic stress”. GA is one of the most important things determining plant height.
Auxin Activity Genes Auxin is a crucial hormone for plant growth and development. Auxin and cytokinin are thought to play major roles determining axillary bud outgrowth and dormancy, and that determines shoot branching.  Auxin has an inhibitory effect on bud outgrowth and cytokinin does the opposite. The ratios of the two hormones determines these effects rather than the absolute levels of each. Article on this: http://www.plantphysiology.org/content/127/4/1405.full.pdf+html. 
Row 566 (-4.4) SAUR1-auxin-responsive SAUR family member in maize. Auxin-responsive SAUR gene in Arabidopsis and rice (SAUR 1 in rice). SAUR = small auxin up RNA. Most members of this gene family are induced by auxin and they reduce polar auxin transport—the flow and distribution of auxin up and down between shoots and roots--which is a critical part of plant flower, seed, and vegetation development. SAUR reduces root and shoot growth and seed yield in rice; reduces rice polar auxin transport and increases abscisic acid and anthocyanin levels when over-expressed. Can be up-regulated by environmental factors. 
SAUR genes have been little studied in maize and their roles are not well understood.  However, one study (Wu and McSteen 2007) showed that “the phenotype of plants treated with auxin transport inhibitors is very similar to that of barren inflorescence 2 and barren stalk 1 mutants (a trait of bs1 mutants is fewer tassel branches), suggesting that these genes function in the same auxin transport pathway. We determined that bif1 is expressed upstream and ba1 is expressed downstream of auxin transport, enabling us to integrate the genetic and hormonal control of axillary meristem initiation”. There were far fewer tassel branches in the late glacial and early Holocene chambers.
From Chen et al on maize SAURs. 79 SAUR genes in maize were identified.  “SAUR genes are observed mainly expressed in growing hypocotyls or other elongating tissues, implying that they play a role in the regulation of cell elongation”. “In general, most members of ZmSAURs were expressed at higher levels in root and leaf tissues or organs, and showed lower expression levels in endosperm and seed”.  
    Kebrom et al. “Cytokinin biosynthesis is reduced by auxin and exogenously applied cytokinin can promote bud outgrowth to overcome apically derived auxin [29,32]. In addition, there is a correlation between the level of abscisic acid and bud dormancy [33].”

Some of them act the opposite to SAURs by enhancing auxin transport in the plant. In Arabidopsis, PIN5 regulates intracellular auxin compartmentalization by transporting auxin from the cytosol into the ER lumen. Important in growth responses to environmental stimuli.  Other PINS determine the availability of auxin and its transport out of cells and direction. Less auxin efflux influence on auxin transport=Dwarf phenotype, blocking of axillary meristem initiation, and fewer tassel branches (see above under SAUR genes).

Auxin efflux in maize;   http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/12/19/mp.ssr103.full.pdf+html
From Forestan and Varotto in the paper “The Role of PIN Efflux Carriers in Polar Auxin Transport…Shaping Maize Development”:  “Auxin biosynthesis and transport function synergistically to regulate the formation of axillary meristems and lateral organs in maize. The contribution of auxin polar transport, a peculiar property of auxin, is important in creating the hormone gradients that control the above list of developmental processes ”. From  Forestan and Varotto--Auxin itself upregulates the transcription of many long PINs and ZmPIN1 may play a role in polar auxin transport.
From Forestan and Varotto: ZmPIN1 probably plays a role in maize vegetative development: “In maize seedlings and young plants, ZmPIN1 transcripts and proteins are detectable in the coleoptile (sheaf protecting the young shoot tip), in the inner central region of the shoot apical meristem, in the lateral outgrowing primordia, in the tips of young leaves, and in vascular bundles of the apex and leaves.” After germination, IAA (auxin) polar transport in the coleoptile is mediated by basally localized ZmPIN1 proteins. 
 From Kebrom et al., Strigolactones can also affect PIN1 protein accumulation and reduce polar auxin transport in some plants. From Peer et al. Arabidopsis article. Auxin transport is enhanced in the absence of flavonoids (transparent testa4 [tt4]) and reduced in the presence of excess flavonols (tt7 and tt3).

Knotted (Knox) Genes 
Row 812 (1.70) Knotted-like transcription factor family protein in maize.  It is a homeobox gene. Homeobox protein knotted-1 in rice and KNOTTED-like homeobox of Arabidopsis thaliana 7.  In maize Knox 1 directly regulates gibberellin synthesis through effects on the GA catabolism gene ga2ox1; it is also involved in auxin and cytokinin. Knox 1 impacts tassel branch number (more of Knox 1=more tassel branches) and seed yield (more of Knox 1=greater cob size and seed yield). The tissues where KN1 naturally accumulates at high levels are immature ears, tassels, and shoot apical meristem.
Fig. 3 in Bolduc et al. is very informative in way of Knox 1 activity with other genes. From the Bolduc et al. Knox 1 maize paper: “a peak of Knox 1 loci was identified in a region that behaves as an enhancer for expression of teosinte branched1 (Studer et al. 2011). KN1 recognizes in vitro a motif present in this region that is conserved in maize landraces, modern inbreds, and teosinte (Supplemental Figs. 6C, 8). These data suggest that distantly located KN1-bound regions may represent enhancers important for gene regulation.”  Also they say, “KN1 could directly contribute to the formation of lateral organs through specific spatiotemporal modulation of auxin synthesis, transport, and signaling. A complex equilibrium between the different hormones is crucial for proper meristem maintenance and organ initiation, and our results support a model in which KN1 plays a major role in the establishment and maintenance of this equilibrium. Our results show that KN1 stands at the top of an intricate regulatory network involving hormonal pathways and transcriptional regulators. ”

Jasmonate, Ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) and AP2 (APETALA 2) genes. In plants, cross-talk between ethylene and jasmonate signaling pathways, or the action of either one, determines the activation of a set of important inducible defense responses against herbivores and pathogens. Apetala genes in maize can also control floral and seed development. Ethylene-responsive factor 1 is upregulated by jasmonate in Arabidopsis.

AP2/ERF transcription factors “intimately regulate gene expression in response to hormones, biotic and abiotic factors, symbiotic interactions, cell differentiation, and stress signalling pathways in plants.”  In rice, one of the AP2/ERF factors restricts internode elongation by down regulating gibberellin, for example. This effect actually increases seed yield in rice. Article-- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165871/pdf/216.pdf

Cytochrome 450 Activity, including with relation to Strigolactone/Caretenoid cleavage dioxygenase8. Cytochrome p450s are a large gene superfamily involved in a large array of reactions, including lignin biosynthesis, detoxification of xenobiotics, and hormone metabolism. Some directly regulate the biosynthesis of strigoloactone (SL), a new hormone discovered that is involved in (suppresses) shoot branching.  SL=more ABA in many plants. There is a very interesting recent paper on strigolactone (SL) in maize by Guan et al. There appears to have been an uncoupling in maize of the Tb1 subnetwork from SL signaling that in Arabidopsis and other plants leads to reduced lateral branching and apical dominance. Guan et al. suggest it happened during recent maize evolution. This is also associated with a loss of CARETENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE8 (CCD8) during maize evolution. A zmccd8 mutant is epistatic to tb1 with respect to branching.

Brassinosteroids and related [C3HC4 type (RING finger) and Leucine-rich repeat kinase] genes. Brassinosteroids (Brs) are essential plant hormones involved in growth and development and stress responses.  Brs have strong growth-inducing properties. They interact with other hormones including auxin, ABA, and gibberellin and have an additive effect with gibberellin. Br-deficient plants are dwarfs in Arabidopsis and maize, and in maize they exhibit flower feminization. Brs control flower sex determination in maize (Hartwig et al. article below). “Brassinosteroids (BRs) require an active BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) receptor serine/threonine kinase for hormone perception and signal transduction.” (Ehson et al. article).

Row 1475 (-1.78) Uncharacterized protein in maize (zinc finger domain). It is brassinosteroid-responsive RING-H2 in Arabidopsis.  It is Zinc finger, C3HC4 type domain containing protein in rice. In rice and Arabidopsis these genes are stress-, hormone- and light-responsive elements. In Arabidopsis a RING-H2 increases ABA synthesis (Ko et al. paper). From Ma et al., article: “12 rice C3HC4 RINGﬁnger genes were regulated by hormones, such that all these 12 genes were affected by ABA, JA and BR, 7 genes were inﬂuenced by IAA, 7 genes were regulated by GA3, and 6 genes responded to KT.”  In maize, abiotic and hormone stress responses are indicated (Wang et al. and Yuan et al., articles, below). This gene family also appears to be associated in function with E3 ligases, a number of genes of which are differentially expressed (below).

A Br gene general review article: file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/RNA%20Seq/Brassinosteroids%20and%20Plants.pdf	
In maize (from Hartwig et al., 2011 “Brassinosteroid control of sex determination in maize”)  “BRs control sex determination in maize revealed through characterization of the classical dwarf mutant nana plant1 (na1), which also feminizes male flowers.  “BRs promote masculinity of the male inflorescence. ….These findings suggest that, in the monoecious plant maize, BRs have been coopted to perform a sex determination function not found in plants with bisexual flowers.” 
From Ehson et al. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 in Arabidopsis article: “. The emerging picture of BR signal transduction reveals that plant steroids, in contrast to the primary mode of action of animal steroid hormones, are perceived at the cell surface by one or more members of the large family of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR RLKs) found in plants”.

ARM, Armadillo Repeat Family Proteins ARMs represent a new family of E3 ligases in Arabidopsis and rice. They promote protein-protein interactions and regulate a large number of cellular functions. They are little studied in maize. From review article below: They are “a major regulatory network that permits plants to integrate internal and external signals within minutes into a cellular response that involves the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. E3 ligases play central roles in phytohormone signal transduction, namely ethylene, auxin, jasmonic acid, gibberellic acids, and strigolactones.”
